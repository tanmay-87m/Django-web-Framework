## Overview

By working through the lessons in this course, you've learned the necessary skills and knowledge to create a website in Django by creating a project and an app.

You were provided with code snippets and tasked with using these, plus your own code, to create a website that showcases the menu pages of the Little Lemon restaurant.

Users visit the homepage and can navigate to the pages About, Menu and Book using the main menu.

The menu page contains a list of the menu items that are stored in the database. Each menu item has been added using the Django Administration user interface and contains the following information:

- Name
- Price
- Description
- Image

Each menu item contains a link that displays a dedicated page for the individual item.

You will now take part in a peer review exercise in which you will submit your completed project for two of your peers to review. You will also be required to review a project of two of your peers.

The grading criteria are covered in more detail below.
